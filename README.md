panda_examples
==============

These are examples for functionality of Panda3D. They are meant to be as minimal as possible, each showing exactly one thing, and each be executable right out of the box. The intention is rather to get you started than being complete examples of anything, though in the future further examples will delve into more advanced features.

basics
------

Let the camera rotate around the camera with your left and right cursor key.

Features demonstrated:
* Loading a model and attaching it to the scene graph
* Events
* Tasks
* Moving a node

bullet_physics
--------------

Features demonstrated:
* Setting up and stepping a physics simulation
* Adding a Rigid Body
* Apply an impulse

cubemap
-------

This one sets up a scene and saves a cube map snapshot of it a six images in industry standard format. This should later come in handy to precreate skyboxes.

Features demonstrated:
* Save a cube map

FSM
---

This sets up a simple state machine that lets a sphere rotate clockwise, counterclockwise or not at all. Using the left and right cursor keys, you can switch between states.

Features demonstrated:
* Finite State Machine
